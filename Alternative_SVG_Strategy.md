# Alternative SVG Strategy (Since Gemini URLs Keep Breaking)

## The Problem
Gemini keeps providing broken/outdated URLs for SVGs. We need 19 equipment types now, not 8.

## Multi-Source Solution

### Phase 1: Get Basic Icons from Reliable Sources (I can fetch these)
**Heroicons & Lucide (both have working GitHub repos):**
- bodyweight ‚Üí person/user icon
- dumbbells ‚Üí Could use weight/fitness icon if available
- pull_up_bar ‚Üí Could use minus/line icon
- yoga_mat ‚Üí Could use rectangle icon
- bench_step ‚Üí Could use box/square icon

### Phase 2: Ask Gemini to Generate SVG Code (Not URLs)
**For specialized fitness equipment, ask Gemini to CREATE the SVG code:**

```
"Create simple SVG code (not URLs) for these fitness equipment icons. 24x24 viewBox, black stroke, no fill:

1. Kettlebell - classic shape with handle
2. Medicine ball - round ball with seam lines
3. Resistance bands - elastic bands with handles
4. Battle ropes - wavy rope design
5. Stability ball - large exercise ball
6. Bosu ball - half-dome shape
7. Suspension trainer - straps with handles
8. Slam ball - textured round ball
9. Weight plates - round plates with center hole
10. Resistance loops - small loop bands
11. Parallette bars - small parallel bars
12. Ab wheel - wheel with handles
13. Ankle weights - strapped weights
14. Jump rope - rope with handles

Output each as complete <svg> code I can copy."
```

### Phase 3: Emoji Fallbacks (Immediate Solution)
For MVP, use emoji initially:
- üèãÔ∏è dumbbells
- ü§∏ bodyweight
- ‚öΩ medicine ball
- üßò yoga mat
- üì¶ bench/step
- ‚ûñ pull-up bar

## Implementation Priority:
1. **Start with emojis** (works immediately)
2. **I'll fetch basic icons** from Heroicons/Lucide
3. **Ask Gemini for custom SVG code** (not URLs)
4. **Replace emojis progressively**

Would you like me to start by fetching the basic icons I can get from reliable sources?
