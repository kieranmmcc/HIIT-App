A Comprehensive Sourcing Guide to SVG Icons for HIIT Application Interfaces
Section 1: Executive Summary & Primary Recommendation
Introduction
This report provides a curated, actionable list of high-quality, free, and commercially usable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons tailored for a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) fitness application. The primary objective of this analysis was to identify a single, visually consistent icon set that fulfills a specific list of eight equipment types while adhering to strict criteria for style, format, and licensing. The findings are intended to equip development and design teams with production-ready assets and a clear guide for their implementation.

Primary Finding
The comprehensive analysis concludes that the Tabler Icons library is the optimal source for the required assets. It offers the most complete and stylistically cohesive set of icons that meets all specified user requirements. This includes a minimalist, monochrome aesthetic, a permissive MIT license suitable for commercial projects, and extensive customization options.

Key Justification
The recommendation of Tabler Icons is based on its superior performance across four critical evaluation criteria:

Completeness: Tabler Icons provides direct or highly suitable proxy icons for all eight requested equipment types. Where direct representations are unavailable, conceptually appropriate and stylistically identical alternatives have been identified from within the same library, ensuring a complete and functional set.

Consistency: All icons within the Tabler library are meticulously designed on a strict 24x24 pixel grid with a default 2px stroke width. This rigorous design system guarantees perfect visual harmony and a professional, unified appearance when the icons are displayed together in an application interface.   

Licensing: The library is distributed under the MIT license, a permissive open-source license that grants the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the icons in commercial applications without requiring attribution in the user interface. This provides legal certainty and removes design constraints.   

Customizability: Tabler Icons are fundamentally designed for flexibility. As raw SVG assets, their core properties—including size, color, and stroke width—can be easily manipulated via CSS or component props, allowing for seamless integration into any application's unique design system.   

Report Roadmap
The remainder of this report provides an in-depth analysis to support this recommendation. Section 2 offers a detailed examination of the curated Tabler Icons set. Section 3 explores strong alternative solutions, including the Lucide icon library, and provides a rationale for excluding other popular sets. Section 4 delivers a practical deep dive into the licensing terms. Finally, Section 5 presents a technical guide for implementing and customizing the selected icons in a modern development workflow.

Section 2: Primary Recommendation: The Tabler Icons Set
2.1. Overview of the Tabler Icons Design System
The Tabler Icons library is a comprehensive, open-source collection of over 5,900 icons, purpose-built for clarity and simplicity in modern web and application interfaces. Its design philosophy is rooted in minimalism and consistency, making it an ideal choice for user interfaces where quick recognition and low cognitive load are paramount, such as in a fast-paced HIIT application.   

The visual consistency of the library is not accidental but is the result of a strict set of core design principles applied to every icon:

Grid and Size: Each icon is designed on a 24x24 pixel grid. This standardized canvas ensures that all icons share a common scale and proportion, preventing visual imbalances when they are placed alongside each other. This is a common and effective standard for UI iconography, ensuring legibility across various screen densities.   

Stroke Width: The default stroke width for every icon is 2px. This uniform line weight is a defining characteristic of the Tabler aesthetic, giving the set its clean, technical, and cohesive feel. A crucial feature of the library is that this stroke width is not baked into the shapes but is an SVG attribute that can be programmatically customized, allowing designers to adjust the visual weight of the icons to perfectly match their typography and UI components.   

Style: The primary style is minimalist, monochrome line art (often referred to as "outline" style). This approach avoids unnecessary detail and relies on clear silhouettes to convey meaning, which aligns perfectly with the user's request for a simple and clean design. The library also offers "filled" style variants for many icons, providing additional design flexibility for states like "selected" or "active".   

This clean, geometric style is particularly well-suited for a fitness application. In a HIIT context, users need to parse information quickly between exercises. The legibility of Tabler Icons at small sizes, their ability to communicate concepts without ambiguity, and their unobtrusive nature ensure that the interface supports the user's workout rather than distracting from it.

2.2. Curated Asset Matrix: Tabler Icons for HIIT Workouts
A significant challenge in sourcing icons for specialized domains is the presence of "icon gaps," where direct representations for specific objects do not exist. A thorough search of the Tabler Icons library revealed direct matches for common equipment like dumbbells and kettlebells, but not for more niche items like pull-up bars or resistance bands. The solution is not to mix icon sets, which would violate the primary goal of consistency, but to curate logical and conceptually appropriate substitutes from within the same library. This process involves selecting abstract icons that represent the essential form or action of the equipment, thereby maintaining perfect stylistic cohesion.

The following table presents the curated set of eight icons from the Tabler library. It includes direct matches and carefully selected proxy icons, complete with direct download URLs to the raw SVG files in the official GitHub repository, ensuring stability and access to the latest versions.

Table 1: Curated Icon Set - Tabler Icons

Equipment Type	Icon Name (in source)	Direct SVG Download URL	Source Collection	License	Style Description & Rationale for Selection
Bodyweight	stretching	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/stretching.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	
A clean, abstract line-art icon of a human figure in a dynamic pose. It perfectly represents bodyweight exercise, warm-ups, or general movement without relying on specific equipment imagery.   

Dumbbells	dumbbell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/dumbbell.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	A classic adjustable-style dumbbell silhouette. The design is clear, instantly recognizable, and precisely matches the set's 2px stroke weight, making it an unambiguous representation.
Resistance Bands	oval-vertical	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/oval-vertical.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	Proxy Icon. This abstract shape is an excellent representation of a loop-style resistance band. It captures the essential "loop" form, maintains perfect stylistic consistency, and effectively conveys the concept to the user.
Kettlebell	kettlebell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/kettlebell.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	A standard, well-proportioned kettlebell icon. Its form is unambiguous and adheres to the library's minimalist design language, ensuring immediate recognition by users familiar with HIIT equipment.
Medicine Ball	ball-volleyball	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/ball-volleyball.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	Proxy Icon. A simple, round ball icon. While named "volleyball," the minimal seam lines are subtle and effectively denote a weighted sphere, making it a suitable and visually consistent proxy for a medicine ball.
Jump Rope	wave-sine	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/wave-sine.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	Proxy Icon. This icon represents the dynamic, wave-like motion of a jump rope. This abstract choice focuses on the activity of cardio rather than the object itself, a strong iconographic approach for a HIIT app.
Pull-up Bar	separator-horizontal	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/separator-horizontal.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	Proxy Icon. A simple, horizontal line. This is the most minimalist and abstract representation of a pull-up bar, focusing on its essential form. It avoids visual clutter and is ideal for a clean, modern UI.
Yoga Mat	yoga	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabler/tabler-icons/master/icons/outline/yoga.svg	Tabler Icons	MIT	This line-art icon of a person in a yoga pose represents the context of mat-based exercises (stretching, core work), which is functionally equivalent in a HIIT app menu and avoids cluttering the UI.
2.3. Visual Consistency Assessment
The harmony of the curated set presented above is a direct result of the Tabler Icons' robust design system. Every icon, whether a direct representation or an abstract proxy, shares the same visual DNA. This shared language is defined by several key attributes: a consistent line weight of 2px, a uniform approach to corner radii (typically sharp, geometric angles), a consistent level of detail, and a shared geometric construction based on the 24x24 grid. Because the proxy icons for the resistance band (oval-vertical) and pull-up bar (separator-horizontal) are drawn from the very same system, they do not feel out of place. Instead, they integrate seamlessly, appearing as deliberate, minimalist representations rather than compromises. This ensures the final set presented in the app's UI will look professional, cohesive, and intentionally designed.

Section 3: Secondary & Alternative Solutions
While Tabler Icons stands as the primary recommendation, a thorough analysis requires the consideration of other high-quality alternatives. This section evaluates Lucide Icons as a strong second choice and provides a clear rationale for why other popular libraries were not selected.

3.1. Lucide Icons: A Strong Contender
Lucide is an excellent open-source icon library that originated as a community-driven fork of the popular Feather Icons set. It has since grown to include over 1,600 icons, all governed by a permissive ISC license and supported by an active community. Its design philosophy is very similar to Tabler's, prioritizing clarity, simplicity, and consistency.   

A brief comparative analysis shows that Lucide's style can sometimes feel slightly softer or more rounded on certain icons compared to the more geometric feel of Tabler. Like Tabler, its library has gaps for the specific fitness equipment list, necessitating a similar curation of proxy icons to achieve a complete set. It stands as a highly viable alternative for any project seeking a clean, minimalist aesthetic.

The following table presents a complete, curated set of eight icons sourced exclusively from the Lucide library.

Table 2: Alternative Icon Set - Lucide Icons

Equipment Type	Icon Name (in source)	Direct SVG Download URL	Source Collection	License	Style Description & Rationale for Selection
Bodyweight	person-standing	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/person-standing.svg	Lucide	ISC	A minimalist, gender-neutral human figure icon. Simple, clean, and universally understood as representing a person or bodyweight exercise.
Dumbbells	dumbbell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/dumbbell.svg	Lucide	ISC	
A clear, simple dumbbell icon. Its style depicts fixed-weight ends rather than adjustable plates but is equally effective and clean.   

Resistance Bands	grip	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/grip.svg	Lucide	ISC	Proxy Icon. This icon represents a handle or grip, which is a common feature on tube-style resistance bands. This approach focuses on the point of interaction with the equipment.
Kettlebell	weight-kettlebell	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/weight-kettlebell.svg	Lucide	ISC	A standard kettlebell shape that is clean and immediately recognizable. It is fully consistent with the Lucide design language.
Medicine Ball	circle-dot	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/circle-dot.svg	Lucide	ISC	Proxy Icon. A simple circle, representing a ball. The central dot can be interpreted to imply weight or a target, making it a suitable abstract icon for a medicine ball.
Jump Rope	activity	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/activity.svg	Lucide	ISC	
Proxy Icon. The classic "heartbeat" or "pulse" line is an excellent metaphor for cardiovascular activity, which is the primary purpose of a jump rope in a HIIT context.   

Pull-up Bar	minus	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/minus.svg	Lucide	ISC	Proxy Icon. This is the simplest possible representation of a horizontal bar. This ultra-minimalist approach ensures zero visual clutter and maintains stylistic purity.
Yoga Mat	rectangle-horizontal	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/rectangle-horizontal.svg	Lucide	ISC	Proxy Icon. A simple rectangle representing a rolled or flat yoga mat. This is a direct, geometric representation of the object's fundamental shape.
3.2. Other Noteworthy Libraries (and Why They Weren't Chosen)
Several other reputable icon libraries were evaluated and ultimately not recommended for this specific use case.

Phosphor Icons: This is a high-quality library with a unique and powerful multi-weight feature, offering styles from "Thin" to "Fill" and "Duotone". While excellent, it was not the primary recommendation because its default "Regular" style is slightly bolder and more assertive than the requested minimalist aesthetic. Furthermore, it suffers from the same icon gaps for specific fitness equipment, offering no significant advantage in completeness over Tabler or Lucide for this project. It remains an outstanding choice for projects that specifically require multiple icon weights or filled/duotone styles.   

Heroicons: Backed by the creators of Tailwind CSS, Heroicons are exceptionally well-crafted and widely used. However, the library is significantly smaller than Tabler or Lucide. This limited size makes it far less likely to contain the specific niche icons required for the fitness equipment list, making it an impractical choice for achieving a complete set without mixing sources.   

Font Awesome Free: Font Awesome is one of the most popular icon libraries available, but its free tier is insufficient for this project's needs. The research confirms that essential fitness icons, including a basic dumbbell, are locked behind the Font Awesome Pro subscription. This makes the free version a non-starter for building the required set and is a critical consideration for any project operating on a limited budget.   

Section 4: Licensing and Commercial Use Deep Dive
4.1. Understanding Permissive Open-Source Licenses
For any software application, especially a commercial one, the legal terms governing third-party assets are as important as their visual quality. The "free" nature of the recommended icon sets extends beyond cost; it encompasses the freedom from restrictive legal obligations that could compromise the project. The MIT and ISC licenses are considered the gold standard for open-source assets in commercial software for the legal certainty they provide.

Unlike other licenses that may require attribution in the UI (e.g., Creative Commons BY) or have "copyleft" provisions that could affect the application's proprietary source code (e.g., GPL), the MIT and ISC licenses are specifically designed to be as permissive as possible. They grant extensive rights with minimal obligations.

MIT License (Tabler Icons): This license explicitly grants permission to "use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software". The sole condition is that the original copyright and permission notice must be included in a copy of the software's source code or documentation. It does not require any visible attribution within the app itself.   

ISC License (Lucide): Functionally equivalent to the MIT license, the ISC license is even more concise. It grants the same broad permissions to use and modify the software freely. Its only requirement is the preservation of the copyright notice in distributed copies, providing the same level of freedom and legal protection as the MIT license.   

The key takeaway is that both licenses provide peace of mind, ensuring the icons can be integrated into a commercial HIIT app without creating legal risks or unwanted design compromises.

4.2. Best Practices for Compliance
Ensuring compliance with these permissive licenses is a straightforward and non-intrusive process. Adhering to standard professional software development practices will satisfy all requirements. The following checklist provides a simple, actionable path to full compliance:

Create an Attributions File: In the root of the application's source code repository, create a plain text file named LICENSES.md or ATTRIBUTIONS.md.

Include the License Text: For each open-source library used (e.g., Tabler Icons), find its LICENSE file in the source repository. Copy the full, unmodified text of the license.

Paste into Your File: Paste the copied license text into your LICENSES.md file under a clear heading (e.g., "Tabler Icons").

Following these steps ensures that the required copyright and permission notices are included with the software, fulfilling all obligations of the MIT and ISC licenses. This is a standard and respected practice in the software development industry.

Section 5: Technical Implementation and Customization Guide
5.1. Sourcing and Integration Methods
While the request specified direct download URLs, which are provided in the tables above, modern front-end development workflows benefit from more robust and scalable methods of dependency management. Using a package manager like NPM or Yarn is the recommended professional standard for incorporating icon libraries into an application.

This approach offers significant advantages over manually managing SVG files. It provides version control, making it easy to update the icon set to receive new icons or fixes. Most importantly, when used with modern bundlers like Webpack or Vite, it enables "tree-shaking". This process intelligently includes only the specific icons imported into the application in the final production bundle, discarding the thousands of unused icons. This drastically reduces the app's final file size, leading to faster load times and a better user experience.   

Method 1: Direct SVG Download (Manual)
This is the most straightforward method and is suitable for small projects or static websites.

Use the URLs provided in the tables in Section 2 or 3 to download the raw SVG files.

Save these files into a dedicated directory within the project, such as /src/assets/icons/.

The icons can then be used directly in HTML, either via an <img> tag or, for more styling flexibility, by inlining the SVG code directly into the HTML document.   

Method 2: NPM/Yarn Packages (Recommended)
This is the recommended approach for component-based frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.

React:

Installation: npm install @tabler/icons-react

Usage: Each icon can be imported as a distinct React component. This method is fully tree-shakable.   

JavaScript

import { IconDumbbell, IconStretching } from '@tabler/icons-react';

function WorkoutHeader() {
  return (
    <div>
      <IconDumbbell size={24} />
      <span>Dumbbell Lunge</span>
      <IconStretching size={24} />
      <span>Warm-up</span>
    </div>
  );
}
Vue:

Installation: npm install @phosphor-icons/vue (using Phosphor as an example)

Usage: Similar to React, icons are imported as components. Note that the Vue library for Phosphor prefixes components with "Ph" to avoid naming collisions.   

Code snippet

<template>
  <div>
    <PhDumbbell :size="24" />
    <span>Kettlebell Swing</span>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { PhDumbbell } from "@phosphor-icons/vue";
</script>
Svelte:

Installation: npm install lucide-svelte

Usage: Icons are imported as Svelte components, allowing for easy integration and prop-based customization.   

Svelte

<script>
  import { Dumbbell } from 'lucide-svelte';
</script>

<Dumbbell color="#FFFFFF" size={24} />
<span>Dumbbell Rows</span>
5.2. Styling and Customization
The primary advantage of using inline SVGs or component libraries is the ability to style them dynamically using standard web technologies. This allows the icons to adapt to different themes (e.g., light/dark mode), states (e.g., active/inactive), and branding requirements.

Changing Color: The stroke color of a line-art icon can be controlled with the CSS color property, just like text. This makes it trivial to match the icon color to the surrounding text or brand palette.

.icon-style {
color: #007AFF; /* Sets the icon stroke to blue */
}
```

Changing Size: The width and height properties in CSS can be used to control the size of the icon.

.icon-style {
width: 32px;
height: 32px;
}
```

Changing Stroke Width: A key feature of libraries like Tabler and Lucide is the ability to customize the line thickness. This can be done either through CSS or, more conveniently, via component props in frameworks like React. This is useful for matching the icon's visual weight to the application's typography.

CSS:

.icon-style {
stroke-width: 1.5; /* Makes the lines thinner */
}
```

React Component Prop:

JavaScript

import { IconKettlebell } from '@tabler/icons-react';

// Renders a kettlebell icon with a thicker, 3px stroke
const HeavyKettlebellIcon = () => <IconKettlebell stroke={3} />;
These powerful customization options ensure that the chosen icon set can be perfectly integrated into the HIIT application's specific design system, resulting in a polished, professional, and visually cohesive user experience.
