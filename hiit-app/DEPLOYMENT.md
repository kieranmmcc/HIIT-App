# HIIT App Deployment Guide

## How It Works Without a Server

This HIIT app is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using React + Vite. It's completely **static** - no server required!

### What happens during deployment:
1. **Build Process**: `npm run build` creates optimized static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
2. **Static Hosting**: GitHub Pages serves these files like any website
3. **PWA Features**: Service worker enables offline functionality and app-like behavior
4. **Mobile Installation**: Users can "install" it on phones like a native app

## üöÄ Deploy to GitHub Pages (FREE)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial HIIT app commit"

# Create GitHub repository and push
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hiit-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The deployment workflow will run automatically

### Step 3: Access Your App
- Your app will be available at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/hiit-app/`
- Wait 2-3 minutes for first deployment
