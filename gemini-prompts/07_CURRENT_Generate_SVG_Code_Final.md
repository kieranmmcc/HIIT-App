Copy and paste this prompt to Gemini:

---

I need you to create beautiful, professional SVG icons for 19 fitness equipment types. I want you to generate the actual SVG code (not URLs) that I can copy and use directly.

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

### Visual Style:
- **Modern, clean, minimalist design**
- **Line art style** (outline icons, not filled)
- **Consistent stroke width** (2px throughout all icons)
- **Professional quality** - should look like they belong in a premium fitness app
- **Instantly recognizable** - users should immediately know what equipment each represents

### Technical Specs:
- **24x24 viewBox** (`viewBox="0 0 24 24"`)
- **Black stroke color** (`stroke="currentColor"`)
- **No fill** (`fill="none"`)
- **2px stroke width** (`stroke-width="2"`)
- **Round line caps** (`stroke-linecap="round"`)
- **Round line joins** (`stroke-linejoin="round"`)

## EQUIPMENT LIST (19 icons needed):

1. **Bodyweight** - Stylized person in exercise pose
2. **Dumbbells** - Classic adjustable dumbbell with plates
3. **Yoga Mat** - Rolled exercise mat
4. **Kettlebell** - Traditional kettlebell with handle
5. **Resistance Bands** - Elastic band with handles
6. **Weight Plates** - Round weight plate with center hole
7. **Suspension Trainer** - TRX-style straps with handles
8. **Medicine Ball** - Round ball with subtle seam lines
9. **Stability Ball** - Large exercise ball
10. **Resistance Loops** - Small loop/mini band
11. **Bench/Step** - Exercise bench or step platform
12. **Slam Ball** - Textured weighted ball
13. **Pull-up Bar** - Horizontal exercise bar with wall mounts
14. **Bosu Ball** - Half-dome balance trainer
15. **Battle Ropes** - Heavy training ropes (wavy design)
16. **Ankle Weights** - Weighted straps/wraps
17. **Parallette Bars** - Small parallel push-up bars
18. **Jump Rope** - Rope with handles
19. **Ab Wheel** - Exercise wheel with side handles

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each icon, provide:
1. **Equipment name**
2. **Complete SVG code** (ready to copy-paste)
3. **Brief description** of the design elements

Example format:
```
1. BODYWEIGHT
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
  <!-- SVG paths here -->
</svg>
Description: Stylized person figure in dynamic exercise pose

2. DUMBBELLS
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
  <!-- SVG paths here -->
</svg>
Description: Classic dumbbell with handle and weight plates
```

## DESIGN INSPIRATION:

Look at these for reference (but create original designs):
- **Feather Icons style** - clean, minimal line art
- **Heroicons aesthetic** - professional and consistent
- **Apple SF Symbols** - clear and recognizable
- **Premium fitness app icons** - modern and sleek

## QUALITY STANDARDS:

✅ **Good icon characteristics:**
- Immediately recognizable equipment shape
- Clean, uncluttered lines
- Balanced proportions within 24x24 space
- Consistent visual weight across all icons

❌ **Avoid:**
- Overly complex details
- Inconsistent line weights
- Abstract shapes that don't look like the equipment
- Cramped or poorly proportioned designs

## SPECIAL REQUESTS:

- **Kettlebell**: Should clearly show the distinctive handle and bell shape
- **Bosu Ball**: Half-dome sitting on a platform base
- **Suspension Trainer**: Show the straps/webbing and handles clearly
- **Battle Ropes**: Use wavy lines to suggest heavy rope movement
- **Weight Plates**: Include the center hole and subtle rim detail
- **Slam Ball**: Add subtle texture lines to differentiate from medicine ball

## FINAL CHECK:

Before providing each SVG, ask yourself:
1. "Would someone immediately recognize this as [equipment name]?"
2. "Does this look professional and modern?"
3. "Is the design clean and uncluttered?"
4. "Does it match the style consistency of the other icons?"

**Please provide all 19 SVG icons with complete, copy-ready code.**
