I need you to find high-quality, free SVG icons for fitness equipment used in a HIIT workout app. Please find direct download URLs for SVG icons that match these specifications:

## Equipment List Needed (8 icons):

1. **Bodyweight/No Equipment** - Icon showing a person exercising or a simple human figure
2. **Dumbbells** - Classic dumbbell icon, preferably adjustable style
3. **Resistance Bands** - Loop band or tube band icon
4. **Kettlebell** - Standard kettlebell shape
5. **Medicine Ball** - Round weighted ball icon
6. **Jump Rope** - Jump rope with handles
7. **Pull-up Bar** - Horizontal bar, wall-mounted or doorway style
8. **Yoga Mat** - Rolled or flat exercise mat

## Icon Requirements:
- **Format:** SVG files only
- **Style:** Simple, clean, minimalist design
- **Color:** Preferably monochrome (black/white) or single color
- **Size:** Scalable (SVG benefit)
- **Consistency:** Icons should look like they belong to the same icon set
- **License:** Free to use (Creative Commons, MIT, or similar)

## Preferred Sources:
Look for icons from these reputable sources:
- **Heroicons** (heroicons.com)
- **Feather Icons** (feathericons.com)
- **Lucide Icons** (lucide.dev)
- **Phosphor Icons** (phosphoricons.com)
- **Tabler Icons** (tabler-icons.io)
- **Font Awesome Free** (fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free)
- **Noun Project Free** (thenounproject.com)
- **GitHub repos** with fitness icon collections

## What I Need From You:

For each equipment type, please provide:
1. **Icon name** (what it's called in the source)
2. **Direct SVG download URL** (the actual .svg file link)
3. **Source website/collection** name
4. **License information** (MIT, CC, etc.)
5. **Brief description** of the icon style

## Output Format:
```
1. BODYWEIGHT/NO EQUIPMENT
   - Icon Name: "user" or "person-running"
   - Download URL: https://example.com/icon.svg
   - Source: Heroicons
   - License: MIT
   - Description: Simple person silhouette

2. DUMBBELLS
   - Icon Name: "dumbbell"
   - Download URL: https://example.com/dumbbell.svg
   - Source: Feather Icons
   - License: MIT
   - Description: Classic dumbbell outline
```

## Priority:
Focus on finding a **consistent icon set** where all 8 icons come from the same collection or have the same visual style. This is more important than finding the "perfect" individual icons from different sources.

If you can't find all 8 icons from one source, try to find them from 2-3 sources max that have similar design styles.

Please search thoroughly and provide the actual download URLs that I can use to fetch the SVG files directly.
