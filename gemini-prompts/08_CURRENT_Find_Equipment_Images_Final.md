## BACKUP PLAN:

If you can't find good photos for some equipment types, suggest:

- Different image sources to try

## FINAL CHECK:

Before providing each URL:
1. "Is this equipment immediately recognizable?"
2. "Is the image high quality and professional?"
3. "Is the background clean/neutral?"
4. "Is this free for commercial use?"
